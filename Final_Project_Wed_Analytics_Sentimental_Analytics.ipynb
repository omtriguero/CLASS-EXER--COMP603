When traveling, the same thing happens, but often can and does get acted upon. When you're abroad, you are so much more relaxed. You chill out and become approachable, and you clearly want to socialize. It's much easier to 'catch a vibe' of a person when you're not in your head. But at the end of the day, who you meet will just be like the kind at home - they can fail or they can succeed, however you define those terms. Just go with the flow.

He told me how the village use to be home to 2k people but only about 50 people live here full time. In the summer it balloons cause of the tourists that come to the beach but it’s not like it use to be. The village was called Platsa. It was a fun afternoon.\n",

The entire time we were there we marveled at the idea that anybody would just show up there as a tourist. It just wasn't set up for that. You would have a very difficult time. Probably easier now. And here I'm talking about downtown of the biggest city. Once you step away from there, forget it. I took a hike through a couple of the villages out in the country once. I am pretty certain that most of the people we ran into that day had never seen a white person before. They were genuinely rattled. And scared. Then they found out we were cool and gave us some snacks.\n",

            "-- In fairness some people definitely do, and also your mileage may vary depending on the type of story. Few people wanna hear about how gorgeous some random place or landmark was, it’s very to the point and has little depth. But some people might want to hear a more adventurous story about how you got lost on a hike and made it home or about a fun night out that led to some crazy 2 am adventure with a random local. Also it depends on how you tell the story. If you’re a bad story teller people probably don’t wanna hear anything at all (not saying you are bad at it, just in general). Lastly, and this sounds pretentious or mean or whatever but I think some of it stems from jealousy  (wrong word, I’m probably projecting a bit) in a way. Or better yet, an inability to relate. I remember not caring at all about people’s study abroad stories in college but part of it was definitely because I never got the chance to. But also, I don’t care about how your 3 months in Europe “changed your life” but I do care about the random debauchery you got into along the way. It all depends. Now, I love hearing about every little thing because having traveled a bit I can relate to these things and I’m thus more interested.\n",

In my opinion a bunch of long trips is better than one really long trip, because with one really long trip it gets harder to get excited about stuff.  I was standing in the middle of Angkor Wat thinking 'meh' because a couple months earlier I'd been in equally impressive temples that were 1000 years old.  Standing in Angkor Wat going 'meh' made me realize I'd been traveling for too long, because Angkor Wat is spectacular.  Don't take this as advice.  Instead take it as a potential warning.  I've met lots of people who have traveled for a year or more and loved it.\n",

After seeing the behavior and mindset of thru-hikers, I've decided to never hike the full AT.  They are robots.  It is all about the miles.  If there is a 300 ft side trail that leads to a spectacular view, they skip it because they aren't there for the views.  They are there for the miles.  And almost all of the AT has no views.  You are in forest for almost all of it.  Instead of hiking for 6 months on a single trail, most of which isn't particularly impressive, I think it would be much better to spend 1 month on the 6 most impressive trails in the world.\n",

The scenery is spectacular, and it is also a cultural experience because you trek from town to town on trails that have been used for 1000's of years.  On the trail with you are kids going to school, farmers going to their fields, and porters carrying supplies.  You sleep and eat your meals in tea-houses so don't have to carry much at all.\n",

Probably the longest hike you could do on the main trails is 4-5 days (well worth it!).  But if you are experienced with desert hiking you could hike the backcountry trails.  This requires a lot more logistics because water is scarce, but you could do a much longer hike.  A long backcountry hike through the canyon is on my bucket list.\n",

Consequently, I'm not pressured to work anymore. I've been embracing travel extensively while still managing a well-paid remote job. As we age, priorities shift. While exploring new places initially brings exhilaration, it eventually assimilates into routine. Personally, despite relishing my adventures, circumstances have led me to prioritize family over constant travel. It's essential, especially as an adult, to be cautious with free time as it can easily lead astray.

Well done for working on yourself I know how tough it can be, and don't be hard on yourself you can grow and learn and still fall in the same traps as you think this one is different. Trust me it's a lesson I'm still learning too. You can get through this, you're strong enough, you've got this! Remember boundaries and self love will never push the right people away. You have to remember you're safe even if that person doesn't stay in your life (as your survival mechanism is kicking in and telling you you're not safe, you have to not be abandoned to survive) and when you end up trying to not be abandoned/rejected by someone you only end up abandoning/rejecting yourself.

Even though I am a woman of a Certain Age, it continually astounds me the lessons and learnings left to experience. Am beginning to believe there will never be a time when all this emotional turbulence stops and only internal peace remains. It doesn’t help that ghosting has recently become okay and a seemingly acceptable form of relationship transition.

And even though it sounds so simple and cliche, all of your relationships will play out according to your relationship dynamic you have with your parents, its really hard as you have never learnt to interact with people in a healthy way and you have to learn yourself. You'll also be drawn to the people similar to your parents because its familiarity in your brain (your brain knows how to act and keep you safe in these situations, it will choose familiarity even if its a trauma response) to repeat the patterns and to finally win that person over and be enough but its a false trap and is the definition of insantiy (doing the same thing over and expectint a different result). The reality is you have to give yourself the reassurance, safety, validation and love that you're enough and you'll eventually stop seeking it externally.

My plan was to start biking from my home in Wisconsin, head out to Seattle, then down the Pacific coast. When my parents divorced three years prior, my mom kept the house. My father, who was already retired, decided to buy a small camper van rather than finding an apartment. He lives in the van full-time, spending the summers in Wisconsin to see my brother and me, then in the winter heading to southern California, Florida, etc. Based on his experiences driving around the country, he thought I should just fly to Seattle, or maybe Denver, and start biking from there.\n",

But the Badlands and Black Hills of South Dakota were simply spectacular, as were Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks in Western Wyoming. The North Cascades mountains of inland Washington State were for a long time my favorite place on Earth, only recently surpassed by a trip to Alaska.

Along the way, I'd been regularly posting photos and stories on my personal Facebook to let my friends and family back home know I was still alive and well. I was absolutely heartbroken to have to end my trip early, and in the post announcing the end of my trip, I didn't hide that fact.

It doesn't look like the open ocean, but that is saltwater, as seen from the town of Anacortes, Washington, north of Seattle. I grew up in Virginia 15 miles from the Atlantic before my family moved to the Midwest when I was 7 years old. Now, I don't live too far from the great lakes, and on a stormy day with big waves, their water stretching to the horizon sure can look like the ocean. But the air out the great lakes doesn't have that salty sea smell, and that makes all the difference to me. So when I arrived in Anacortes and saw the sea for the first time on that trip, it was a huge moment for me. Not just because of my childhood love of the ocean, but also the significance of that moment for my trip. My home was 2,300 miles (3,700 km) and exactly two months at my pace from the Pacific, with two mountain ranges between them. And I'd gone all that way on a freaking bicycle! Picking away at it 60 miles (100 km) per day, it almost didn't feel real, but when I did finally reach Anacortes, it put into scale the true size of what I'd taken on.\n",

The first several times, the nausea would fade away, but eventually it didn't. I used some water from one of my bottles to rinse out my mouth, then drank some to help replenish the fluids I'd lost.

Every single person I met along my way wanted to be a positive part of my story in whatever way they were able. Many incredibly kind locals opened their homes to me for a night, providing me a soft bed, a hot shower, and their wonderful company over a delicious home cooked dinner. Drivers would see me stopped on the side of a desolate road and pull over to offer me an extra bottle of water when I was a million miles from the next town. Neighbors in the next campsite over, after seeing me ride into camp on my bike with all my stuff on it, would come over to ask about my trip. I'd give them a summary of where I'd come from and where I was going, and they would invite me to join them around their fire to exchange their food and beer or a morning cup of tea for my stories. It probably goes without saying that my bike trip was the chapter of my life when I believed in myself more strongly than I ever have before or since.

He told me his hike that day was part of his training for the coming summer, when he hoped to spend three weeks hiking the John Muir Trail, which connects Yosemite National Park to California's highest peak through 200 miles (320 km) of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

I wish I knew this was a thing people did when I was young enough to do it myself.\" I always hated to hear that, because I knew there were people far older than myself doing some incredible things. I'd met a few such people throughout my trip; a 72 year old woman at a hostel in Portland who was driving down the coast solo, a group of three guys around my parents' age doing a week long bikepacking trip north of Los Angeles. But Harold was definitely the most impressive of the bunch. I can only hope that when I'm his age in another 50-some years, I'll still have half his drive to do these things.\n",

I used to share my trips with grandparents because they had traveled to and loved seeing my pictures. Seems like after they passed, nobody cares.  Still today my girlfriend hasn't seen my pictures and hasn't asked. It sucks and my respect for her has considerably gotten less and less.\n",

One of the main driving points that I would tell kids about on their debrief is that they should all keep talking to one another.

We went to five different places who clearly had space available but looked me up and down and told me no until we finally found one place with a man who was very excited to have me stay, but my friend decided not to as she didn’t like the vibe of him. We finally found one more place that allowed me to stay, he was showing me the hotel logbook and the passport copy of an Italian woman that had stayed there about three months ago, as to show me that he understood that I was a backpacker. My friend was unclear as to why people wouldn’t rent to me but had only ever traveled there with family, friends, or a partner, never alone.
